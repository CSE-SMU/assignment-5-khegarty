# Assignment 5 Postmortem

## What's your name?
Katie Hegarty 


## How difficult was this assignment?
This assignment was confusing, although going over it in class and attending the office hours definitely made the assignment doable. 


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
I learned a ton about angular from this assignment, after the last assignment, this one helped with the more complex aspects of angular. 


## How could this assignment be improved?
I think giving us the bare bones for the assignment in class was super helpful, if we could have gotten that earlier it would have been nice! As is, the assignment was pretty well structured and straight forward. 


## Any other comments?
HAPPY THIS IS THE LAST ASSIGNMENT :D (no offense of course)
